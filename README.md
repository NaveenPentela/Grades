# Project Details and Requirements

Overview:
You are required to work in a group working environment of five students with the below-selected data
collection from MongoDB’s sample data collection “grades” and the Open University Learning Analytics
(OULAD) dataset. You can select to work either on “grades” data collection or OULAD dataset; or you can
work on both grades” data collection and OULAD dataset. You will use R code that can run on RStudio,
including all required packages. You will be graded on the quality of your data transformation and analysis,
the accuracy and effectiveness of your data models and visualisations, and the clarity and persuasiveness of
your report and presentation.

Although this is a group working environment, the project is an individual assessment. It means that each
group member will be assessed based on the individual work, as well as the individual submission and
individual performance during the presentation. However, within the group working environment, group
members are expected to actively support other group members if it is applicable.
Selected data collection at MongoDB sample dataset:

Project requirements and general marking criteria:
The project requirements are listed in the following tasks:

Data Wrangling: Loading and tidying the dataset to ensure it is in a clean and usable format.
a) Loading the data accurately
b) Handling missing or incorrect data appropriately
c) Tidying the data effectively

Data Transformation: Using data transformation techniques to transform the dataset into a format
suitable for analysis.
a) Using appropriate data transformation techniques to prepare the data for analysis.
b) Creating new variables as needed

Data Analysis: Analyse the dataset using appropriate statistical methods and create data visualizations
to support your analysis.
a) Using appropriate statistical methods to analyse the data
b) Creating accurate and effective data visualizations

Data Modelling: Creating data models for the relevant variables in the dataset.
a) Creating a simple linear model
b) Creating a general linear model. The model should cover three types of predictors which are
i) Predictors are categorical.
ii) Predictors are categorical and continuous.
iii) Predictors are continuous.
c) Evaluating the performance of the models if applicable
d) Interpretability of the models

Additional marking criteria for project report:
Task 5 of the project report: The report should cover a clear and concise summarizing your findings, including
relevant visualizations and models. The report should not exceed 10 pages (excluding title page, table of
contents, references and appendices). The word count limit is 3000 words, (excluding figures, tables, title
page, table of contents, references and appendices). Note that the title page, table of contents, references
and appendices are not within the scope of marking.

You are not allowed to use identical examples or demonstrations on the same data from the teaching
materials in the workshops and tutorials. While these resources are provided to aid learning and
understanding, the purpose of the project is to assess your ability to independently apply the concepts and
techniques covered in class.
